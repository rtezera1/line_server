News Corp, publisher of The Wall Street Journal
on Tuesday filed a formal complaint with the
commission regarding Google’s competition
practices, a spokesman said. He declined to
disclose further details.
After the complaint is issued, Google would have
about three months to respond, and could request a
hearing to better explain its case. If the EU then
decided to press ahead, a final decision could be
expected by the end of the year, Mr. Lianos said.
Google could then appeal to the EU’s appeals courts in
Luxembourg, a process that could take years. Those
courts in Luxembourg have traditionally been
sympathetic to the commission.
The EU also could impose injunctions requiring Google
to stop any behavior deemed anticompetitive.
